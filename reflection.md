- What are your initial impressions of how `Inheritance` affects your programming?
- What worked, what didn't, what advice would you give someone taking this course in the future?

I liked working with inheritance. I very much understand the utility of building Java around this principle, as it made a lot of things much easier. I also feel more confortable with the general idea of why I've been able to call the same methods (like toString) for multiple different kinds of classes. I feel like I probably could have utilized inheritance more but it's not 100% solid yet so I didn't push the boundaries on that very much.

I actually didn't run into a lot of problems with this assignment. The only big thing was trying to figure out HashTable, which felt strange and complicated (but that's probably just because I was introduced to it This Week). What worked very well was putting together a skeleton of what I wanted to do based on the instructions and leaving myself comments of any complicated things to come back to. This was very nice for budgeting my time because I could dedicate one session of work to setting up the bare bones of my code and then understand how much I actually had to do for each class.
